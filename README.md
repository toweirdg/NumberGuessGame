# Number Guessing Game

A simple command-line number guessing game written in Python and C++.

## Why I Built This
I built this project to practice basic programming concepts such as loops,
conditionals, and user input handling.

## How to Run

### Python
```bash
python numberGuess.py
```
What I Improved
- Added input validation to prevent crashes on invalid input.
-Improved variable naming for better readability.

### C++
```bash
g++ numberGuess.cpp -o numberGuess
./numberGuess
```
